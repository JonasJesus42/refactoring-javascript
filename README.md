## About the Project

This project is a personal initiative to deepen my understanding of refactoring techniques and best practices in JavaScript. Each folder corresponds to a chapter or concept from the book, with practical examples and solutions.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (optional)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
 
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/refactoring-javascript.git
